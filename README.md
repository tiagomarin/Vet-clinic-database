# curriculum-databases-projects-template

This repository was used to practice SQL database during my Microverse program.
I followed some requirements and used SQL on the command line on the terminal, then I copied the code I used in the files of this repository and also took print screens of terminal and posted in the pull requests.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
